This project was a team project during my studies in a course called Software Engineering Project.
It was also my first real project.
We were a group of six people and created this game in JAVA within three months.
Me and a fellow student were mostly involved in creating the GUI and the AI-system.


### What I have learned
- creating GUIs with JavaFX
- working with JavaFX Scene Builder
- create documentation for classes and methods
- working with gitlab
- object-oriented programming

### Possible improvements
If we had more time, we would have:
- improved the performance of the game
- made the GUI more attractive
- changed the AI strategies to make them more complex
- made the gameplay more active

### How to run
To run the game you have to go to ```src/main/``` and run the ```Main.java``` file.
